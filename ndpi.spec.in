%description
nDPI is a ntop-maintained superset of the popular OpenDPI library. Released
under the GPL license, its goal is to extend the original library by adding
new protocols that are otherwise available only on the paid version of OpenDPI.
In addition to Unix platforms, we also support Windows, in order to provide
you a cross-platform DPI experience. Furthermore, we have modified nDPI do be
more suitable for traffic monitoring applications, by disabling specific
features that slow down the DPI engine while being them un-necessary for
network traffic monitoring.

nDPI is used by both ntop and nProbe for adding application-layer detection of
protocols, regardless of the port being used. This means that it is possible
to both detect known protocols on non-standard ports (e.g. detect http non
ports other than 80), and also the opposite (e.g. detect Skype traffic on port
80). This is because nowadays the concept of port=application no longer holds.
